hsh (does not support arguments)

.SH DESCRIPTION
Welcome to the Simple Shell project! This program is a simple shell that can be compiled and launched from the command line within any number of Linux versions. It contains the most basic features and functions found in the various shell programs.

.SH OVERVIEW
The Simple Shell project is a major team project conducted by Gabriel Okemwa and Shamso Osman, students at ALX-Software Engineering, for educational purposes. It consists of developing and makng our own clone of DASH - Debian Almquist shell found in several versions of Ubuntu Linux. Though cloning of DASH was the general guidance, having the same exact functionalities and features was not the goal. The goal for us was to learn and develop various team and individual skills regarding coding and git.
